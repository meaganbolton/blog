## Introduction
Hey there, future employer! Meagan Bolton here, on the brink of wrapping up my fourth year at Brigham Young University. Yep, just a semester away from grabbing that coveted undergraduate degree in statistics, with a double scoop of biostatistics and data science, and a side of math and computer science minors. Phew! Sounds like a mouthful, huh? Well, let me take you on a whirlwind tour of how I ended up here and where I'm aiming to go next.
## Picking My Major and the Biostatistics Emphasis
So, picture this: high school Meagan had her sights set on becoming a doctor, all fired up to make a real difference in people's lives. But then, just a week before diving into freshman year, a lightbulb went off during a chat with my brother-in-law. Suddenly, it hit me like a ton of statistical bricks – I could make that same impact doing something I genuinely adored: statistics.

Enter AP Statistics, stage left. I devoured that textbook like it was the latest bestseller, and boy, did it click! Statistics felt like the missing puzzle piece in my life, where logic met real-world application. So, the decision to major in it? Easy peasy. And biostatistics? Well, that was the cherry on top, leaving the door open for a potential detour to medical school if ever the mood struck.
## Deciding on My Computer Science Minor
Let's rewind to my college debut, where I found myself staring blankly at a professor's request to create a folder on my computer. Spoiler alert: I was clueless. No, seriously – I'd barely scratched the surface of tech beyond Google Docs. That C+ stung, but it also lit a fire under me. I had never in my life gotten such a low grade.

Fast forward a bit, and I'm rubbing elbows with statistics pros, one of whom drops a truth bomb: coding is the secret sauce of being a top-notch statistician. Cue my sprint to the computer science minor finish line. And you know what? Somewhere along the way, coding became my jam. Here I am 2 classes away from finishing and I have a 4.0 in the minor. It feels like solving the world's nerdiest puzzle, and I couldn't get enough.

## Picking Up an Emphasis in Data Science
Now, let's sprinkle in a dash of data science, shall we? With my newfound love for coding and all things tech, diving deeper into the data science realm was a no-brainer. It's like statistics and computer science had a baby, and its name was data science. So, why stop at just a taste when you can have the whole buffet?
## Adding a Math Minor
Ah, math – my childhood crush. From acing every test in high school to breezing through calculus in college, it was a love story for the ages. So, when I realized snagging a math minor was just a hop, skip, and two classes away, sign me up! And hey, turns out my major and minor were a match made in heaven – no extra class required.

## What I Want to Do After Finishing My Undergraduate Degree
Now, onto the grand finale: the future. Learning has always been the great love of my life, I've had this insatiable hunger for knowledge. So, naturally, the idea of continuing my education beyond undergrad has always been on the cards. But here's the thing: I'm not one to sit around twiddling my thumbs while waiting for life to happen.

Sure, grad school is still on my radar, with applications primed and ready to go. But in the meantime, I'm itching to dive headfirst into the bustling world of work. Why wait to make a difference when there are challenges waiting to be conquered and problems waiting to be solved? Whether it's crunching data numbers or pioneering new statistical methodologies, I'm all in.

And hey, let's not forget the thrill of learning on the job – it's like a perpetual motion machine for the mind. With every project, every problem, and every breakthrough, I'll be soaking up knowledge like a sponge in a rainstorm. Who knows? Maybe I'll stumble upon a passion project that leads me down a different path entirely – and I'm more than ready to roll with the punches.

So, while the allure of graduate school is undeniable, I'm not about to let that slow me down. I've got dreams to chase, problems to solve, and a world of opportunities waiting just around the corner. So, here's to the next chapter – let's make it one heck of an adventure!

(This is code from my research. There's no real reason for it to be here except at the time I wrote it I felt like it didn't get enough recognition. It was the first complex problem I needed to solve where I felt like I was really able to put my computer science minor to good use... I would solve it differently now though. It wasn't very efficient but I was doing what I could with the knowledge I had.)
