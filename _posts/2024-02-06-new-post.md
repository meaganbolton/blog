## Introduction
My name is Meagan Bolton. I'm finishing up my 4th year at Brigham Young University and my official major is Statistics with an emphasis in biostatistics. After picking up a computer science minor I realized my love
for coding and technology. I realized that it was a world that I wasn't ready to leave behind and wanted to incorporate more into my long-term profession. Upon this realization, I looked more into a data science emphasis as the data science world was extremely intriguing to me. Data science used all the elements that I had developed a passion for and combined them into the same field. It felt as though I took statistics and was able to expand on it, increasing the knowledge I could gain from data. Looking into the data science emphasis I realized that I was only two classes away from completing it and that's when I decided to do it.
